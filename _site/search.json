During my Ph.D.Â I cofounded an automated digital pathology company, Instapath. I developed educational materials and taught workshops for the Tulane Library, as well as becoming a certified Software Carpentries instructor, before moving into libraries full time. I am open to new projects and collaborations, and you can find me on GitHub or LinkedIn.\nI live in DC with my wife and our dog Chewie - named for the New Orleans Mardi Gras walking parade Chewbacchus.\nThis site was built in R using Quarto, and deployed using Netlify.
