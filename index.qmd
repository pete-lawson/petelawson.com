Hi, I'm Pete, Data and Visualization Librarian at Johns Hopkins University.

I love the statistical programming language R, cycling ðŸš², and sprawling used bookstores with ornery owners.

I studied computational topology at Tulane, exploring the importance of cancer morphology in diagnosis and prognosis, finishing my Ph.D. in 2020. During my Ph.D. I cofounded an automated digital pathology company, [Instapath](https://www.instapathbio.com/){target="_blank"}. I developed educational materials and taught workshops for the Tulane Library, as well as becoming a certified Software Carpentries instructor, before moving into libraries full time. I am open to new projects and collaborations, and you can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/pete-lawson){target="_blank"} or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lawson){target="_blank"}.

I live in DC with my wife and our dog Chewie - named for the New Orleans Mardi Gras walking parade [Chewbacchus](https://chewbacchus.org/){target="_blank"}.
