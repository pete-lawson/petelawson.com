I rely heavily on [participatory live coding](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008090). It is important to keep your configuration as close to your learners as possible, which means sticking with the vanilla, default settings for the applications you are teaching with. \n",
